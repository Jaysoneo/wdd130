        <h2>Jayson Olivares</h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is Jayson Elias Olivares Parra, but you can call me Jayson, and I am 21 years
            old and this is my third semester in BYU-Idaho. Also, I am from Chile (it is in the west 
            coast of South America), and I am a physics major with emphasis on computer science.
        </p>
        <p>I like to learn how things work and the principles behind them; because of that I like a lot every type
            of science ,and I love maths (real math!). I enjoy doing many activities at home, such as reading,
            watching shows ,or building something, but sometimes go outside to ride my bike and go around.
            This semester I joined to a research team, so I have to learn and understand high level physics in order
            to do the research, which is going to be hard, but I love it!
        </p>

            I am taking this course because I wanted to learn more about how webpages and the internet work,
             and this course teach the bases of it; in addition, since my enphasis is in computer science,
             learning more about computers is going to be helpful for my career. Thank you for your time, 
             and thank you for looking my web page.
