      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>In BYU-Idaho there are some research teams and every semester they do progress in different 
        subjects. However, many times all of the knowledge they gathered and discovered is forgoten.
        For this reason, I want to make a webpage to preserve some of the knowledge and publish to the 
        internet in my webpage. Although my goal is to publish knowledge for every team to everyone,
        I am going to start with physics investigations, specifically with positron anihilation investigations.
      </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Students , Proffesors, Investigators, and everyone interested in positron research</p>

        In a damaged sample, atoms within the sample are displaced from their original lattice 
        positions, with greater displacement resulting in regions of higher defect density.
        Eventually, the positron annihilates with the electron shell of neighboring atoms, 
        typically producing two coincident gammas. The energy of these two gammas is determined
        by the rest mass and momentum of both the incident positron and the atomic electron
        with which it annihilates. Measuring the lifetime of the positron by detecting their
        gamma rays it is posible to know the defect density of the sample.

      <h3>About PALS</h3>
      <p>What is Positron Anihilation Spectroscopy Lifetime?
        A positron is created through either a Î² + nuclear decay event or through pair pro-duction.
        In the event of creation through pair-production, the positron may have significant forward
        momentum remaining as a result of the process of its creation. This is unlike positrons 
        created through nuclear decay, which typically have little mo-mentum, as is the case for
        Na22. After undergoing the processes of thermalization, diffusion, and trapping, the positron
        is in a state of very low kinetic energy and in close proximity to its anti-particle, the 
        electron. Positron annihilation is a quantum electrodynamic process in which a positron and
        electron annihilate, that is, convert their mass entirely into energy.

      <h3>Atomic Superposition Software ATSUP</h3>
      <p>
        ATSUP is a software that calculates the positron annihilation lifetime. In order to use
        ATSUP, is required to use a computer with linux. If you are using a mac there is no 
        problem, but if you are using windows, you can install a linux subsystem. In here you can
        find how to install the linux subsystem, how to install ATSUP, how to make input files,and 
        finding and understanding the output files.
