Atsup Code Overview
*******************

This page gives an overview of the code structure to help developers on their
way to make changes to the code and implement new features.


General remarks
===============

Here, we list a couple of points that may make it easier to understand what is
going on in the code.

- The code first calculates the potentials on a 3d real space grid, then solves
  for the positron state on the grid.
- Atomic quantities are stored on (logarithmically spaced) radial grids. Hence
  the code has to project these on the 3d grid before 
- Quite some of the main tasks in the code are designed as a driver routine. It
  decides how something should be calculated, according to the input, and calls
  the appropriate subroutines. 
- The main variables are gathered in several derived types (data structures),
  which are stored in the `glovar` module (in `variables.f90`). The most
  important are: `geom`, `sys`. The first contains all the information related
  with the unit cell, including the atomic data. The `sys` variable contains
  most of the relevant quantities on the 3d real space grid, such as the
  potentials and the 3d electron density. 
- Quite regularly, the `glovar` is used to pass variables around. The reason for
  this is mainly to keep the function calls manageable.


Structure of the code
=====================

The atsup code is quite linear, and performs the following tasks:
1. Read the input.
2. Calculated the Coulomb potential.
3. Determine the electron density on a 3d real space grid.
4. Calculate the correlation potential.
5. Solve the Kohn-Sham equation to obtain the positron wavefunction and positron
density on a 3d real space grid.
6. Determine annihilation properties.
7. Calculate forces on the atoms.


Reading of the input
--------------------

Reading of the input consists of the followin tasks:
1. Parse the `input_atsup` file.
2. Read the `ATOM` file that contains the atomic densities.
3. If specified, a valence electron density is read.


Calculating the Coulomb potential
---------------------------------

The Coulomb potential is determined as 

.. math::

   v_c(\textbf{r}) = 
      v_\mathrm{c,core}(\textbf{r}) +
      v_\mathrm{c,valence}(\textbf{r})

where the core potential :math:`v_\mathrm{c,core}` on the 3d grid is determined
by projecting the atomic core Coulomb potential on the 3d grid. The core part of
the atomic Coulomb potential also takes into account a part of the ionic
potential. More specifically, the potential due to a point charge with the same
magnitude as the core charge of the ionic species. In case of the atomic
superposition, not just the core part but also the valence part is projected.

If a valence electron density is supplied as input, the valence potential is
determined by solving the Poisson equation

.. math::
   
   \nabla^2 v_\mathrm{c, valence} = \rho^e_\mathrm{val} 
      + \sum_i \rho^\mathrm{ion}_\mathrm{i, val}.

Here, the :math:`\rho^e_\mathrm{val}` is the valence electron density. The
charge of the ions :math:`rho^\mathrm{ion}_\mathrm{i, val}` is initially
represented as a gaussian density with a charge exactly opposite to the valence
charge of the ion. If there is excess charge in the unit cell, a uniform
background charge is added to neutralize it. Once the charge density in the
right hand side is constructed, the Poisson equation is solved in reciprocal
space where

.. math::
   
   v_\mathrm{c, valence}(\textbf{G}) = 
      \frac{c_\mathrm{G}}{\vert \mathbf{G} \vert^2}
      \quad for \mathbf{G} \ne 0.

The final potential is obtained by transforming back to real space.

Now the potential due to the gaussian charges is not correct close to the center
of the gaussians. Hence, after solving the Poisson equation, we subtract the
potential due to the gaussians (which we know analytically), and replace it with
the correct point charge potential.


Calculation of the correlation potential
----------------------------------------

In the LDA the correlation potential is simply obtained by calculating a
parametrized function of the total electron density. In case of the GGA, a
correction to the LDA is applied in a second step. Note that in the GGA the
gradient of the electron density is calculated (called somewhere in the main()).

For the WDA, first the sumrule has to be solved, after which the potential can
be obtained by calculating the Coulomb interaction of the positron with its
screening cloud. (To be extended)

(Add some info on the CMM)


Solving for the positron state
------------------------------

Once the Coulomb and correlation potentials are obtained, the positron ground
state is found from

.. math::

   \left( 
      -\frac{m_p}{2} \nabla^2 + v_\mathrm{Coulomb} + v_\mathrm{correlation}
   \right) \psi^p = \varepsilon \psi^p

Note that in general :math:`m_p = 1`. Though, for some purposes it is convient
to be able to rescale the positron mass.


Calculation positron annihilation properties
--------------------------------------------

Once the positron state is calculated, the code proceeds with the calculation of
the annihilation rates. They are obtained from

.. math::
  
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\tau} = \pi r_e^2 c \int d\textbf{r} \rho^e(\textbf{r}) 
      \rho^p(\textbf{r}) \gamma(\rho^e(\textbf{r})).
   
The enhancement factor :math:`\gamma` is obtained from the appropriate
parametrization implemented in the :math:`correlation` module. Note that it is
always the total electron density that enters in the calculation of the
enhancement factor, also when calculating orbital annihilation rates. For the
calculation of the orbital annihilation rates, the total electron density is
replaced by the atomic density of a given shell and species. Keep in mind that
the orbital annihilation rates are also calculated using the atomic densities,
and not the self-consistent electron density if it is provided as input. 

A note on the normalization of the positron density: Since we are working in the
zero-density limit, the positron density approaches zero everywhere. Though, its
integral over space should be equal to unity since we assume there is a single
positron in crystal. Instead of integrating over the entire space, we can
integrate over a single unit cells (all unit cells give the same infinitely
small contribution) provided we normalize the positron density to unity.

The correlation energy is obtained from

.. math::

   E_\mathrm{correlation} = \int d\textbf{r} \rho^p(\textbf{r})
      v_\mathrm{correlation}(\textbf{r}).

Calculation of the forces on the ions
