Run_atsup.py
============

Purpose
-------

Atsup consists of several programs that are typically run consecutively. The
usualy chain is:

   1. xscfa
   2. relorbsc
   3. posc4par
   4. atsup

The ``run_atsup.py`` script is introduced to automate the calling chain. Below
is a brief description of the programs. (A more detailed description should be
added.)

xscfa
~~~~~

This is an (ancient) atomic DFT code that calculates the groundstate electronic
properties for a given atomic species. The input files for most atoms can be
found in ``[atsup_root]/input/free_at/``. To calculate the free atom electronic
properties of a specific atom, run ``[atsup_root]/build/bin/xscfa [atom].in``. 


relorbsc
~~~~~~~~

This program extracts the groundstate electron density from the ``xscfa`` output
and prints it to the stdout. Since ``atsup`` expects this output in the ``ATOM``
file, run the program with ``[atsup_root]/build/bin/relorbsc [atom]_orb >> ATOM``. 


posc4par
~~~~~~~~

Calculates the momentum density in the IPM using a four parameter positronic
wavefunction. A file with parameters can be found in
``[atsup_root]/input/atomic_md/pospara``. Run the program as
``[atsup_root]/build/bin/posc4par [atom].in [pospara] [atom]_wf``. Where
``[pospara]`` is the parameter file mentioned before, and ``[atom]_wf``
respresents the name of the output file. Note that this file creates a series of
outputs of the form ``[atom]_[shell]``, for example ``Si_1s``, that contains the
IPM momentum density for that particular atom and shell.


Parameters
----------

The ``run_atsup.py`` script has a couple of options, of which a brief
description is given by calling ``python run_atsup.py --help``. Below follows a
more detailed description.

Options
~~~~~~~

**--no_atoms** :

   Run ``atsup`` without any atoms in the unit cell. Usefull for calculations on
   the homogeneous electron gas.  This options skips some consistency checks in
   the script.


**--atoms_only** :

   Only run ``xscfa`` and ``relorbsc``. Useful if only the atomic properties are
   to be calculated.


**--no_checks** : 

   Skip consistecy checks in the script. Not recommended, unless you are really
   sure that your input is correct.


**--vasp_auto** : 

   Automatically set all parameters in the ``input_atsup`` file required to run
   a an ``atsup`` calculations with the VASP files present in the current
   directory.

   If no ``input_atsup`` file exists, the script generates a new one with the
   basic parameters extracted from the VASP files. If an ``input_atsup`` file
   exists, the parameters that can be extracted from the VASP files with
   overwrite the same entries in the existing file. Other parameters, such as
   the electron-positron correlation potential are reproduced.

   The script extracts the following information from the VASP files:

   **CHGCAR** : Names of the atomic species, number of atoms of each species 

   **POTCAR** : Names of the atomic species, valence electron charge of the
   species.

   **INCAR** : Number of electrons in the unit cell (``NELECT`` tag).

   If any inconsistencies are discovered between these files, an error is
   thrown. From this information, and the script generates the
   ``input_eldenval``, ``species_names``, ``species_charge``, ``excess_charge``
   parameters that go in the ``input_atsup`` file.

**--potcar** : 

   With ``--vasp_auto``, specify the name of POTCAR file. 

   *Default:* ``--potcar ./POTCAR``

**--chgcar** :

   With ``--vasp_auto``, specify the name of the CHGAR file.

   *Default:* ``--chgcar ./CHGCAR``

**--incar** : 

   With ``--vasp_auto``, specify the name of the INCAR file.

   *Default:* ``--incar ./INCAR``
