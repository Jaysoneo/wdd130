                    What is Positron Anihilation Spectroscopy Lifetime? A 
                    positron is created through either a Î² + nuclear decay 
                    event or through pair pro-duction. In the event of 
                    creation through pair-production, the positron may 
                    have significant forward momentum remaining as a result 
                    of the process of its creation.This is unlike positrons 
                    created through nuclear decay, which typically have 
                    little mo-mentum, as is the case for Na22.

                <p class="paragraph2">
                    After undergoing the processes of 
                    thermalization, diffusion, and trapping, the positron 
                    is in a state of very low kinetic energy and in close 
                    proximity to its anti-particle, the electron. Positron 
                    annihilation is a quantum electrodynamic process in 
                    which a positron and electron annihilate, that is, 
                    convert their mass entirely into energy.

                <h2>Detection System</h2>
                <p> The detection system is made of several devices, and 
                    all them together have the objective of detecting the 
                    lifetime of positrons.
                    The devices for the dection system are two photo multiplier
                    tubes with their respective scintillator, two discriminator
                    boxes, two delay boxes, one fast coincidence box, one
                    amplitude to time converter, one data adquisition equipment
                    (Lynx).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scintillators transform a gamma ray into visible light; then,
                    the photo multiplier tubes transform the visible light into a pulse of voltage.
                    There are three diferent type of pulses,
                    a birth pulse, that comes from the birth of a positron; a death pulse,
                    that comes from the annihilation of a positron, and noise pulses that come from background sources.
                    Those noise pulses are filtered when they go through the discriminator boxes. After that,
                    the pulses go to the fast coincidence box and to the TAC (time to amplitude converter).
                    The TAC detects the time between a birth and a death pulse, but in order to detect them,
                    it needs to know when it should start. For that reason, is necessary a delay box. Finally, 
                    the TAC sends another pulse with the information of the time measured to a data adquisition
                    equipment, in this case it is a device called Lynx, and the results are seen in a computer
                    connected to the Lynx.
