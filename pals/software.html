                    ATSUP is a software that runs in Linux, and 
                    it is used to calculate the positron annihilation
                    lifetime.

                <h2>Requirements for ATSUP</h2>
                <p>
                    Linux: A computer needs to have a Linux operative system.
                    Macs already use linux, but windows computers
                    require to install a linux subsystem. The reason for 
                    this is that the software only runs in linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Input Files: ATSUP runs and give an output file once it
                    has the necessary input files. These input files are two,
                    one that tells about the geometry of the atoms, and the
                    other tells about the parameters for the calculation.
                </p>

                <h2>Using ATSUP Example</h2>
                <section class="input">
                    <h3>Input File</h3>
                    <img src="images/input.png" alt="input file">
                    <p>
                        atsup mode: 0 tells that the software is running
                        in atomic superposition. The other parameter is 
                        1, and it runs using files from another software
                        called VASP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        input geometry: "".true. 2" means that is importing a 
                        file of the geometry of the sample, the name of 
                        that file is POSCAR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        species_names: Si is importing the element with the
                        symbol of Si ,which is silicon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        species_charges: Tells about the electrons in silicon
                        the total number of electrons, the core electrons, and
                        the valence electrons respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        grid: tells about the precision of the calculation,
                        in this case it is a 40x40x40 grid. The bigger the 
                        grid, the more precise is the calculation, but it 
                        requires more time to calculate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The program reads the words and interprets that as a
                        command, then, the parameters under the command are 
                        used for the calculation. Finally, if the last parameter
                        is a command, the program runs that command
                        with it respective parameters, otherwise the calculation is done.

                        In this file are the details of how are aranged the
                        atoms in the sample.
                    </p>
                    <p> Cristals can be described as a structure that is 
                        repeated, this structure is called cell, and it 
                        is made of atoms.
                        The are two ways to describe 
                        a cell, one is the primitive which has the least 
                        amount of volume, and the other is the standard, which
                        has the standar form of describing a cell (usually 
                        easier to describe).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 5.43 represent the distance between Si atoms in amnstrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The three set of numbers represent the vectors that describe the 
                        position of the atoms in the cell. For Si the cell is diamond
                        cell, which can be understood as two face center cubic (fcc) cells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Si: represent the element, in this case silicon
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2: The number of initial points, in this case, there are two
                        since a diamond cell can be described with to fcc cells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Direct: The type of coordinate, in this case
                        in respect to the cell. The numbers represent
                        the starting point of each cell.

                    <p class="last-geo-p">
                        Notes: Although in this example it was used only one type of atom, 
                        in the calculations it is possible to add more types of atoms  ,for example, sodium chloride.
                        Also, there were not deffects in this calculation.
