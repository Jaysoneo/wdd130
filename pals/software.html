                    ATSUP is a software that runs in Linux, and 
                    it is used to calculate the positron annihilation
                    lifetime in different materials.

                <h2>Requirements for ATSUP</h2>
                <p>
                    Linux: A computer needs to have a Linux operative system.
                    Macs already use linux, but windows computers
                    require to install a linux subsystem. The reason for 
                    this is that the software only runs in linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Input Files: ATSUP runs and give an output file once it
                    has the necessary input files. These input files are two,
                    one that tells about the geometry of the atoms, and the
                    other tells about the parameters for the calculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Physics: In order to make the input files, and understand
                    the output files it is necessary to know some of the 
                    basics of solid state physics and atomic physics. 
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="example">
                <h2>Here there is an example of running ATSUP</h2>
                <section class="input">
                    <h3>Input File</h3>
                    <img src="images/input.png" alt="input file">
                    <p>
                        atsup mode: 0 tells that the software is running
                        in atomic superposition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        input geometry: .true. means that is importing a 
                        file of the geometry of the sample, the name of 
                        that file is POSCAR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        species_names: Si is importing the element with the
                        symbol of Si ,which is silicon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        species charges: tells about the electrons in silicon
                        , the inner electrons, and the valence electrons
                        respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        grid: tells about the precision of the calculation,
                        in this case it is a 40x40x40 grid. The bigger the 
                        grid, the more precise is the calculation, but it 
                        requires more time to calculate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice that the titles are comments and no commands, 
                        for example "grid" does nothing, but it is helpful 
                        to know what each of these numbers are.

                        In this file are the details of how are aranged the
                        atoms in the sample.

                    <p>
                        Primitive cell of Si: the are two ways to describe 
                        a cell, one is the primitive which has the least 
                        amount of atoms, and the other is the standar, which
                        has the standar form of describing a cell (usually 
                        easier to understand).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 5.43 represent the distance between atoms in amnstrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        the three numbers represent the vectors that describe the 
                        position of the atoms in the cell.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Si: represent the element, in this case silicon
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2: The number of atoms in the calculation. Remember that each
                        verticie has a fraction of an atom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Direct & numbers: The type of coordinate, in this case
                        in respect to the cell. The numbers represent the coordinates
                        of each atom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notes: Although in this example it was used only one type of atom, 
                        in the calculations it is possible to add more types. Also, there
                        were not deffects in this calculation.
