                <p>
                    Using a radioactive sample that beta decays, it is possible to measure
                    properties of a material by detecting how the radiation interacts 
                    with the material. Specifically, when the positions
                    are born, they emmint a gamma ray that can be detected. After a while,
                    the positron will anihilate with an electron of the sample measured.
                    Measuring the time between, it is possible to measure the defect
                    density of a damaged sample.

                <p>In a damaged sample, atoms within the sample are displaced from
                    their original lattice positions, with greater displacement resulting
                    in regions of higher defect density. Using a radioactive sample,
                    it will beta decay producing positrons; these positrons 
                    annihilate with the electron shell of neighboring atoms, typically 
                    producing two coincident gammas. The energy of these two gammas is 
                    determined by the rest mass and momentum of both the incident positron 
                    and the atomic electron with which it annihilates. Measuring the
                    lifetime of the positron by detecting their gamma rays it is posible 
                    to know the defect density of the sample.

                <p>
                    In order to detect the lifetime of the positrons
                    we need to set up a speciliced system to detect them.
                    This system detects the gamma rays emmited when the 
                    positrons are born and dead. These gamma rays are
                    transformed into voltages and signals. If it is detected a 
                    birth signal and then a death signal, the system measures
                    the time between them, and sends that time as a voltage
                    to a data adquisiton system.
